#Hi! This document is an R "script". A script is sort of like a Word file, but
#for code. You can write in this script and use it to edit your code and also to
#take notes on your code, as well.

#Because scripts usually include code, we have to designate anything that is NOT
#code, so that RStudio won't try to run regular text as code. In R, the way we
#do that is by including "#" at the beginning of a line. The "#" indicates that
#we're just taking notes and not writing code.

#Scripts are one type of R file that we'll be working with this semester. I'll
#be asking you to complete your first pre-class work assignment, for Session 2,
#in a script like this one.
